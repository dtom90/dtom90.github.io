Today I discovered the magic of [Jekyll][jekyll-home], a beautiful framework for transforming plain text into static websites and blogs.

In fact, this very website is built using Jekyll, and I'm still learning all the capabilities. One nice feature is that it integrates very seamlessly with GitHub Pages. The source code for this site is all hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/dtom90/dtom90.github.io](https://github.com/dtom90/dtom90.github.io) and is built automatically from the master branch of the repository.

Since I'm a big fan of the JetBrains IDE family, I'm choosing to develop this within RubyMine using the [Markdown Navigator](http://vladsch.com/product/markdown-navigator) plugin developed by [Vladimir Schneider](http://vladsch.com/).  

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
