Today I am publishing a new web application: GitHub Contributor. The idea is to be able to get contribution information from a particular user and see more details than what GitHub shows on the standard profile page. For example, a user could navigate to the site from a smartphone and view the contribution graph, which the GitHub profile does not display on mobile by default.

Eventually the app will be able to display more advanced graphs for projecting cumulative contributions by a certain date, total and average contributions each week, and much more. To see the current status of the project, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dtom90/github-contributor).

Try the app out at: [https://github-contributor.mybluemix.net/](https://github-contributor.mybluemix.net/){:target="_blank"}
