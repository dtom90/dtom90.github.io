My name is David Thomason. I'm a software developer who is very passionate about writing good code.

I currently work for IBM as a Software Architect. However, in my free time, I like to engage in projects that interest me, especially open-source projects on GitHub.

Check out some of the projects I've been working on by going to the [home page](/) of this portfolio or to my GitHub profile: {% include icon-github.html username="dtom90" %}
