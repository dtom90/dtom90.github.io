## General
- **project_type**: React + Vite single-page app, deployed to GitHub Pages under `dtom90.github.io`.
- **languages**: JavaScript/JSX (ESM), CSS; avoid adding TypeScript unless explicitly requested.
- **style**:
  - Prefer functional React components and hooks.
  - Keep components small and presentational where possible.
  - Use modern JS (ES2015+) and avoid legacy patterns like class components.
- **files_scope**:
  - Treat `src/` and `public/` as the primary active code and asset directories.
  - The `old/` directory contains legacy Jekyll content; do not modify it unless the user explicitly asks.

## Formatting & Linting
- **javascript**:
  - Use 2-space indentation.
  - Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
  - Use strict equality (`===`, `!==`) unless there is a clear reason not to.
  - Prefer named exports or default exports consistently per file; keep current style when editing.
- **react**:
  - Use JSX with double quotes for props where consistent with existing code.
  - Keep components as pure as possible and avoid unnecessary state.
- **css**:
  - Prefer editing existing `App.css`, `index.css`, and other existing CSS files rather than adding new CSS frameworks.
  - Keep class naming consistent with the current project (no large-scale renames unless requested).

## Tools & Commands
- **runtime**: Prefer Bun (`bun`) over npm for scripts and package management.
- **dev_server**: Use `bun run dev` for local development.
- **build**: Use `bun run build` for production builds.
- **preview**: Use `bun run preview` to test the production build locally.
- Do not add new scripts or dependencies without a clear, explained benefit or explicit user request.

## GitHub Pages / Deployment
- Assume deployment is via GitHub Pages from the built output (e.g., `dist/`).
- Keep paths and assets compatible with static hosting (avoid server-only APIs).
- Avoid introducing features that need a custom backend unless the user explicitly wants it.

## Assistant Behavior
- Before making non-trivial code changes, briefly state goals and the high-level approach.
- Prefer modifying existing components (`App.jsx`, `MainSection.jsx`, `ProfileSection.jsx`) rather than introducing many new components, unless it clearly improves structure.
- When adding new files, keep names descriptive and consistent with existing naming (`PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for helpers).
- When the user asks conceptual questions, answer concisely and avoid changing code unless requested.
- Avoid making changes in `old/` Jekyll files, `Gemfile`, or legacy assets unless the user explicitly references them.

## Testing & Safety
- Always try to run or reason about `bun run build` implications when adding React or Vite features that may break production.
- Avoid introducing experimental browser APIs or features that may not work across modern evergreen browsers unless called out to the user.

## Documentation & Comments
- Keep inline comments short and focused on "why" rather than "what".
- When adding or changing behaviors that might not be obvious, add a brief comment or update any nearby documentation if it exists.

## Tailwind Theme Customization
- **Theme updates**: All theme customizations (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) must be made in `tailwind.config.cjs` under the `theme.extend` object.
- **Colors**: Use semantic color names in the theme (e.g., `text.primary`, `text.secondary`, `background.primary`) rather than generic color names. Add new colors to the theme instead of using arbitrary values like `text-[#94a3b8]`.
- **Typography**: Define custom font sizes with line heights in `theme.extend.fontSize` (e.g., `text-heading-1`, `text-body`). Use these custom sizes in components rather than inline font-size styles.
- **Spacing**: Add custom spacing values to `theme.extend.spacing` when needed for consistency across the app.
- **Component styling**: Always prefer Tailwind theme classes over inline styles. Use theme color classes (e.g., `text-text-primary`, `bg-background-primary`) instead of hardcoded hex values or generic Tailwind colors.
- **No inline styles**: Never use inline `style` props for styling. Always use Tailwind utility classes instead. If a needed utility class doesn't exist, add it to the Tailwind config theme rather than using inline styles. Only use inline styles for truly dynamic runtime values that cannot be predefined (e.g., user-generated content, calculated positions).
