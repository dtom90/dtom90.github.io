### SpaceX | Software Engineer
*2022 – 2024*

* **Tech Stack:** Angular, TypeScript, .NET, Python, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Helm, Kafka, Azure, Terraform
* Graph Database Application for Design & Manufacturing Data
  * Solved challenges of tracking frequent design changes and build discrepancies for complex rocket hardware by replacing a slow, query-complex legacy ERP system.
  * Developed a graph database solution with Kafka streaming for real-time data analysis, enabling fast data traversals and improved scalability.
  * Engineered 'As-Built' data traversal to capture current manufacturing status using physical part data (e.g., serial numbers).
  * In collaboration with Build Engineers, designed and implemented reconciliation logic to match design specifications with actual built components, identifying missing or inconsistent elements.
  * Built a reusable C# framework for consuming Kafka messages and populating graph data, accelerating the integration of many data types.
  * Delivered a system capable of answering critical queries, such as "Find all instances of part X in assembly Y" and "Find mismatches between design & build".
* Gantt Chart Scheduling System for Test & Launch Operations
  * Addressed managing of complex rocket test schedules, which were previously handled with static excel files, and involved critical time constraints and numerous event dependencies.
  * Developed a dynamic scheduling application to create events, define dependencies between them, and automatically propagate any schedule adjustments to downstream activities.
  * Focused on the dependency management aspect, including UI work for visualizing event relationships and backend logic for storing these relationships and correctly rescheduling downstream events using topological sorting.
  * Integrated streaming of work order and operation data from the ERP system to provide real-time data for the scheduling application.
* Led design & development of a property management system
  * Designed, built & deployed system from the ground up
  * In-house system to track the construction, waitlist, and leases for on-site housing
  * Implemented multi-stage waitlist review/approval process
* Site Information & Map Mobile App
  * Led the ground-up design and development of a "Google Maps for SpaceX" equivalent web and mobile application, serving as a central information hub for employees, their families, and third-party partners at the Starbase facility.
  * Architected a flexible system utilizing a headless CMS; designed distinct data handling strategies for less-sensitive public information and sensitive internal data, replicating data out to the network for enhanced security.
  * Implemented the solution on a public cloud leveraging Terraform for infrastructure, an API gateway, a Kubernetes cluster, object storage for assets, and SSO authentication.
  * The successfully rolled-out system comprised a client application (Angular), a headless CMS with an authentication guard, object storage for assets like images and files, and an API connected to a relational database.
* Improved system used for tracking risk tickets across rocket hardware
* Maintained and updated supply chain management system
