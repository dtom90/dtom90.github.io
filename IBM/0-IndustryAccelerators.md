Each accelerator includes a structured set of business terms. The glossaries provide the information architecture that you need to effectively analyze your data.

The accelerators also include sample data science assets that you can use to accelerate your analysis. The assets include:
- Sample data sets and schemas
- Jupyter notebooks that you can use to cleanse and prepare the data, run machine learning algorithms, and score the resulting models
- Sample dashboards to display the results interactively
- API endpoints that you can call from other applications
